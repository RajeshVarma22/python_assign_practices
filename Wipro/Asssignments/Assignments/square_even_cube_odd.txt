Task 1 : Pseudocode deelopment
Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. 
Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.


Start
num = give a number
Condition to check whether it is an odd or even
If num % 2 equals to 0 then
    numSquare = 1
    
    for i from 0 to 2:
        numSquare *= num
    loop end

    print numSquare
Else
    numCube = 1

    for i from 0 to 3:
        numSquare *= num
    loop end

    print numCube
End
